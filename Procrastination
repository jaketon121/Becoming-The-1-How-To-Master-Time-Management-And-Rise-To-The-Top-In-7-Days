Procrastination 

There has been more materials written about procrastination than anyone could or should ever read. Ranging from Harvard studies to self-help articles, it has been built up in our culture as some kind of demonic figure that hovers constantly,restraining us from getting any work done. This is absurd! Procrastination comes from lack of clarity and direction. Our minds love to move towards goals. Goal completion generates endorphins. The problem comes when your mind doesn't know exactly what it should do next and why it is doing it. It then begins filling your time with whatever it wants to do. 

It is going to find another way to make itself happyâ€“ Facebook, online videos, chats with co-workers, etc. 

The key to overcoming procrastination is to have a plan. It is that simple. 

============================= 

Inertia 

In physics, inertia is the property of physical objects to resist any change in motion. Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, which means laziness. How does this apply to productivity? The principle of inertia tells us that it takes more energy to get started than it does to keep going. The ability to overcome inertia is the single biggest skill that a productive person can develop. We have times when we know we need to get started on a task, but we just can't bring ourselves to take the first step. Eventually we do and then it is like a floodgate has opened. 

We suddenly are able to work on it relentlessly until we complete it. We don't even consider the thought of stopping and we get upset when we get interrupted. I had a very difficult time getting started on writing this chapter this morning. I was in a mellow mood and I was sluggish. I finally opened up the page and told myself to just type one sentence. 

Now, I have been writing for an hour and I don't want to stop until I finish the whole book! Sometimes, you are not going to want to take the first step, but once you start, inertia will keep you going. 
======================================== 


Performance anxiety Similar to inertia, performance anxiety is the feeling you get that stops you from starting a task because it seems too big to handle. I like to describe this with a simple illustration. If I were to ask you and 100 other people to build the Great Wall of China, your reaction would be predictable:discontent, discouragement and a general sense of not feeling that it was a goal that can be accomplished. This is because your mind is so focused on the overall monumental goal of building the Great Wall that you can't possibly see the first step, yet alone take it. This is what I describe as performance anxiety, the feeling you get when a task is so large, you can't take the first step. Now, if instead I were to ask you to just lay down a hundred bricks a day for the next 30 years, as long as you were compensated fairly, it wouldn't take much to get you started. This is the key to conquering performance anxiety. By taking a goal or a task and breaking it up into smaller pieces, you can make it so that the first step is easily obtainable and the momentum you generate will propel you forward into completion.

Poor planning 

Successful people are long-term thinkers. They understand how their short-term actions affect their long-term goals and because of that, they are more motivated to accomplish their daily tasks. 

If you utilized only one thing from this book, then I would beg of you to start planning your life out. The world will only give you what you are ready for and prepared to receive. The only way to be ready is to plan for it to happen. The more you do it, the more habitual it will become. I have known people who have only done this and have reached goals that they never thought possible in an incredibly short time. 

If you are not willing to do this, then I will not be able to help you. Nothing else in this book will work without proper planning. If you do commit to becoming a planner, I will show you how to make success a reality and how those plans will skyrocket you to new levels in your career and life! 

There is one last thing we need to cover before you begin your You are going to need to make five promises to yourself. These are the promises that every productive person must make. 

Promise #1 Do something every day that will move you closer to your goal. No matter how big or small, resolve to do something and never miss a day. 

Promise #2 Put everything in writing. If it is not in writing, then it is not real. Plans, goals and dreams, put them all in writing. 

Promise #3 Practice these skills. Becoming productive is no different than any other skill. You have to work at it every day. You have to internalize these practices until they become second nature to you. 

Promise #4 Keep your work space clean. This was one of the hardest things for me to do, especially while working from a home office, but it makes a significant difference. A clean space allows for clean and clear thoughts. Look around your work environment at any given time and ask yourself: "What kind of person would work here?" Promise 


#5 Spend as much time as possible on your real work. This is the work that will have the largest impact on your life and your career. Spend as little time as possible on your pseudo work. Period. 

Exercise: Visualizing Success Close your eyes and picture your ideal productive self. This is the version of you that you are working to become. This person walks away at the end of the day feeling a strong sense of satisfaction. Think about what that person does every day. More importantly, what does that person not do? The way you see yourself on the inside is the person you will become on the outside. Try to do this once a day while you are going through this book. You have now officially taken the first step on your journey. Look at the next seven days as a test to see what kind of person you really are. This path will reveal your true character.
